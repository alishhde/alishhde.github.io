  Hi, my name's Ali and I'm a Computer Engineering Student, a Tutor, a Researcher, and as well as a knowledge seeker.
  I'm in love with the Artificial Intelligence concepts specially the part in which you 
  can build unblievable robots or an intelligent agent what can think, interact, learn and do its
  defined jobs in its more flexible way. I love any field or research when AI is part of it.  WOW the lifelong ambition... :)
  <br/>
   - I am most skilled in: 
      - <mark>Programming</mark> specially with <mark>python</mark>
      - <mark>Internet of Things</mark>
      - <mark>Teaching</mark>
      - <mark>Researching</mark>
  
   - I am really interested in: 
      - <mark>Machine Learning</mark>
      - <mark>Natural Language Processing</mark>
      - <mark>Data Mining</mark>

          University of Mazandaran (UMZ), currently the largest state higher education center in the province of 
          Mazandaran, had formerly consisted of a number of tertiary education centers. In 1979 the centers were
          officially merged to form what is now known as University of Mazandaran.  In recent years, UMZ has 
          made significant progress, expanding itself with vision both qualitatively and quantitatively.

          During my time at UMZ I learnt most of my key skills. The academic works I have done helped me to grow my career more and more and I'm now looking
          forward to continue this situation in my graduate programs. I want to continue my academic works as I can see there are a lot more knowledge
          to be discovered and problems to be solved in the world.

          I have spent a lot of my time in the Lab working as an assistant in my last year of education.

          Used Python to implement a module containing ***BFS, DFS, Greedy,
          UCS, A* etc*** algorithm. These algorithms have been implemented on
          the 8 puzzle problem as the default problem.

          Used Python and Digits dataset from SKLearn module and different
          ready to use algorithm like KNN, RandomForest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 
          XGboost and LinearRegression to train the digits' dataset to create an 
          estimator which can predict and classify the input image. I've done similar 
          project in Matlab Workshop course as well.

          Used Python to implement a Windows Shop Center application. 
          This application has three part, customer, store manager and main
          manager. I have used Sqlite3 for database and QT for its GUI.

          With this application you can easily manage main and basic work of
          a file manager like, deleting or adding a new directory or file,
          change directory easily and create text files and its texts and many more.
